# SQL eCommerce Customer and Order analysis

## Background

E-commerce companies utilize insights from historical transactional data to make informed business decisions that drive sales, increase revenue, and grow their businesses overall.

## Goal

To write SQL queries to extract specific information on customers, their demographics and associated products ordered over a defined period to inform advertising campaign and investment efforts to drive revenue generation.

## Methodology

## Data Source

I extracted Customer, Sales, and Product datasets from a PostgreSQL database using SQL queries. 

## Folders and Files in the Repository

There is a README.md file which summarizes the project goals, data tables and methodology, results, insights and recommendations.

1. The `data` folder contains the three datasets used in the analysis:
+ `customer.csv`
+ `sales.csv`
+ `product.csv`
  
2. The `scripts` folder contains two SQL query files:
+ `DTC_queries.sql` which contains SQL queries I used to create and populate the customer, sales and product tables within the PostgreSQL database for analysis.
+ `eCommerce_KPI_analysis.sql` which contains SQL queries I generated to answer questions important for driving revenue growth and marketing efforts.

## Data processing

1. I wrote SQL queries to create customer, sales and product tables within the PostgreSQL database and populate them with records from `.csv` tables.

2. Next, I wrote SQL queries to answer key questions to better understand customer demographics and product order performance.

## Questions answered
